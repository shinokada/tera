While playing a station, if I `b` keyboard shortcut, it add the station to block list. Block list should be saved in a file.

In the main menu page, add a block list page.

Block list page should have the following features:

- View blocked radio stations
- Remove a station from the block list
- Clear the block list
- Import block list from a file (Is gist a good option?)
- Export block list to a file (Is gist a good option?)
