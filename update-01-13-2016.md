## Summary of Changes to "I Feel Lucky"
I've added a Main Menu option to the "I feel lucky" feature in /Users/shinichiokada/Bash/tera/lib/lucky.sh:
### What's New:

- Updated prompt: Now shows Genre/keyword (or type 'menu' to return to Main Menu):
- Type 'menu' to return: You can now type menu, Menu, or MENU (case-insensitive) to return to the Main Menu without playing a station
- Empty input handling: If you press Enter without typing anything, it will automatically return to the Main Menu with a message

### How to use:
When you select "5) I feel lucky":

- Type a genre/keyword (like jazz, rock, meditation) to play a random station
- Type menu to return to the Main Menu
- Press Enter with no input to return to the Main Menu

## Summary of Menu Improvements
### TERA LIST MENU (/Users/shinichiokada/Bash/tera/lib/list.sh) ✅
Changes:

- Moved "Main Menu" option to position 0) at the top of the menu
- Changed wording from "Go back to the main menu" to simply "Main Menu"
- "Exit" is now option 5) at the bottom

New menu order:
```md
0) Main Menu          ← At the top now!
1) Create a list
2) Delete a list
3) Edit a list name
4) Show all list names
5) Exit
```
### Delete a Radio Station (/Users/shinichiokada/Bash/tera/lib/delete_station.sh) ✅
Changes:

- Changed "0) CANCEL" to "0) Main Menu" (appears twice in the interface)
- Now typing "0" will return to the Main Menu (previously only empty input would)

Updated text:
```md
0) Main Menu          ← Changed from "CANCEL"
     0  Main Menu     ← Changed from "CANCEL"
```
These changes create a more consistent navigation experience throughout the application, with "Main Menu" always being option 0 at the top, and clearer labeling of what each option does!

## Summary of SEARCH MENU Update
TERA SEARCH MENU (/Users/shinichiokada/Bash/tera/lib/search.sh) ✅
### Changes:

- Moved "Main Menu" to position 0) at the top of the menu

1) Tag
2) Name
3) Language
4) Country code
5) State
6) Advanced search
7) Exit
```
### Complete Menu Consistency 🎉
Now all menus in TERA have a consistent structure:

- 0) Main Menu is always at the top
- Exit is always at the bottom
- All action items are in between

This creates a much more intuitive and predictable navigation experience across the entire application!

## Summary of All Changes - Headings Added to Every Page ✅
I've added clear, consistent headings to all pages in TERA using Title Case format (e.g., "Delete a Radio Station"). Here's what was added:

### Menu Consistency Updates:
Also updated the Gist Menu to match the same structure as other menus:
```md
0) Main Menu          ← At the top
1) Create a gist
2) Recover favorites from a gist
3) Exit              ← At the bottom
```
Now users will always know exactly where they are in the application! Every page has a clear cyan-colored heading at the top that shows the current section or function.
