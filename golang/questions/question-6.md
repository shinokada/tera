1. Can you remove the following keyboard shortcut utilities from the footer menu.
- **/** — Filter/search current list~~
- **i** — Show detailed info (context-dependent)


2. I want to show Search result with one line.
The following is the current display
```text
  101 SMOOTH JAZZ
  The United States Of America • MP3 128kbps      
```

3. When I select a station shows the following. But I just want to play the station. Can you remove the following menu?
```text
    What would you like to do?  
                                
  > 1. Play this station        
    1. Save to Quick Favorites  
    2. Back to search results   
```

================

When I search and click a station, the following is display.
```text
 💾 Save Station? 

Did you enjoy this station?

ABC Lounge Radio

1) ⭐ Add to Quick Favorites
2) Return to search results

y/1: Yes • n/2/Esc: No

It should play the station without this prompt and show the staion status/ play list from station.
