1. In the main menu, I click 3) Manage Lists and I see the following.
```text
                                   
1/4                                
↑/k up • ↓/j down • q quit • ? more

1-4: select • esc/0: back • q: quit
```

I think there is not enough height so show 1 to 4. It should display the options. Please see 5. List Management Menu Screen in golang/spec-docs/flow-charts.md.
And there is no page title at the top.

2. This is Play from Favorites page:

```text
 Play from Favorites 

                                   
                                   
                                   
1/2                                
↑/k up • ↓/j down • q quit • ? more

↑/↓: navigate • enter: select • esc: back • q: quit
```

This page is supposed to show all the lists that I made in the Manage Lists.
