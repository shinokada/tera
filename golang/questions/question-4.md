1. While playing a radio station, press q to quit tera but the station runs after quiting tera.
2. I search and play a station, only 1. Play this station is visible. I need to use j/k or arrow to show more menu. So, the screen height is too short. It should be longer.
3. After playing a station and quit then it should show Save prompt. Please see 4. Search Results Screen in golang/spec-docs/flow-charts.md.
4. After searching, then press / to filter and type, but the number of result doesn't change.
5. Escape to back to Search Radio Station, again I see only 1. Search by Tag. Should the height be higher so that I can see all the options? What do you think?
